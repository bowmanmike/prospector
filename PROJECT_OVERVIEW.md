# Prospector

An AI-powered knowledge discovery tool for Obsidian vaults that helps you find,
connect, and rediscover your notes through intelligent search and passive
organization.

## Project Overview

Prospector is a Next.js/TypeScript application that provides a search-first
interface for your existing Obsidian vault. Instead of forcing manual
organization, it uses a local LLM (via Ollama or LM Studio) to understand your
notes' content and surface relevant connections automatically.

### Core Philosophy

- **Search-first**: Built for people who prefer searching over manual sorting
- **Passive organization**: Organize in the background without user overhead
- **Privacy-first**: All processing happens locally with your own LLM
- **Local-only**: No cloud deployment, runs entirely on your machine
- **Obsidian-compatible**: Works with your existing vault structure

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Local LLM**: Ollama or LM Studio integration
- **File Processing**: Direct filesystem access to Obsidian vault
- **Search**: Vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Database**: Local SQLite for metadata and embeddings
- **Deployment**: Docker/Docker Compose for local distribution

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Local LLM Integration

- Support for Ollama and LM Studio APIs
- Model selection for different tasks (embeddings vs. text generation)
- Fallback handling when LLM is unavailable
- Batch processing for large vaults

### File System Integration

- Watch for changes in vault directory
- Handle file moves, renames, and deletions
- Respect Obsidian's file structure and naming conventions
- Support for different markdown flavors

### Search Architecture

- Hybrid search combining keyword and semantic results
- Efficient vector storage and retrieval
- Incremental indexing for large vaults
- Search result ranking and relevance scoring

### Storage Architecture

#### Files as Source of Truth

Prospector follows a **files-first architecture** where markdown files in your Obsidian vault remain the single source of truth. The application never modifies your vault files and always reads content directly from the filesystem on-demand. This ensures:

- **No sync issues**: Files modified outside the app are immediately current
- **Data integrity**: Your vault cannot become corrupted by application issues
- **Portability**: Your knowledge base exists independently of the application
- **Transparency**: You can always inspect, backup, and migrate your actual markdown files

#### Storage Strategy

**SQLite Database:**
- Vault directory paths and connection state  
- User interface preferences and settings
- Application state and configuration
- File metadata (path, modified time, size, hash)
- Extracted frontmatter (tags, title, created date, custom fields)
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Computed statistics and search indices
- Cache invalidation tracking

**On-Demand Operations:**
- Full markdown content parsing for display
- Content processing for search and analysis
- File system watching for change detection

This architecture provides fast metadata queries and search capabilities while maintaining the filesystem as the authoritative source for all content.

#### Modern Next.js Architecture with Server Actions

The application follows a clean three-layer architecture using Next.js 15 Server Actions:

**1. Database Layer (`src/lib/database/queries/`)**
- Raw SQL queries and database operations
- VaultQueries, NoteQueries, TagQueries classes  
- Type-safe database interfaces
- Transaction support and error handling

**2. Business Logic Layer (`src/lib/handlers/`)**
- Pure functions that implement domain logic
- Database-agnostic business rules and validation
- Returns domain types, throws domain exceptions
- Pre-initialized with database connection for performance

**3. Server Actions Layer (`src/app/actions/`)**
- Next.js 15 Server Actions for direct server-side function calls
- Type-safe client-server communication
- Automatic loading states and error handling
- Built-in support for revalidation and caching

This modern architecture provides:
- **Better DX**: Direct function calls instead of HTTP routes
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript from frontend to database
- **Performance**: Automatic optimizations and caching
- **Testability**: Direct function testing without HTTP mocking
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

### Data Storage

- SQLite for metadata, embeddings, and search indices
- File-based cache for processed content
- Backup and restore functionality
- Data migration strategies

### Local Deployment

- Docker containerization for consistent environments
- Docker Compose orchestration with LLM services
- Volume mounting for vault access and data persistence
- Environment configuration for different setups
- No external dependencies or cloud services

## Safe Development Workflow

To protect your main Obsidian vault during development, set up a one-way replica
using Syncthing:

### Syncthing Setup (Recommended)

1. **Install Syncthing** on both your main system and development environment
2. **Configure Main Vault** as a "Send Only" folder in Syncthing
3. **Configure Dev Replica** as a "Receive Only" folder in Syncthing
4. **Point Prospector** to read from the replica directory, never the original

This ensures:

- Real-time sync of changes from main vault → dev environment
- No risk of accidental modifications to your original vault
- Full testing capability with current data
- Easy rollback if anything goes wrong

### Alternative Options

**File Watcher Script**: Create a Node.js script that watches your main vault
and copies changes to dev replica

```bash
# Simple rsync alternative
rsync -av --delete /path/to/main/vault/ /path/to/dev/replica/
```

**Git-based** (if vault is in Git): Clone your vault repo to dev environment,
periodically pull changes, never push from dev

### Development Safety Checklist

- [ ] Prospector only reads from replica, never writes to original vault
- [ ] Sync is one-way: main → dev only
- [ ] Test file operations on replica first
- [ ] Backup your main vault before any major testing
- [ ] Keep dev environment clearly separated from production

## Current TODOs

### High Priority
1. **Implement markdown parsing**: Add support for parsing markdown files with frontmatter extraction
2. **Create note management**: Build note CRUD operations using Server Actions pattern
3. **Add vault statistics**: Display note counts, tag counts, and file statistics in UI

### Medium Priority
- **Multi-vault support**: Allow users to store and switch between multiple vaults (not simultaneous access, but vault selection/switching)
- Add comprehensive error handling for file system operations
- Implement proper logging system to replace console.* usage
- Add integration tests for full Server Actions workflows
- Implement file watching for vault changes

### Low Priority
- Add dark/light theme matching Obsidian
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Add export/import settings functionality

## Success Metrics

- **User adopts search-first workflow**: Reduced time spent on manual
  organization
- **Improved note discovery**: Users find and reference older notes more
  frequently
- **Enhanced productivity**: Faster access to relevant information
- **Seamless integration**: Works naturally with existing Obsidian workflows
